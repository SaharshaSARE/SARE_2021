# Preparing your computer for computational research

## Documenting your computational resources

In any computational project, knowing the specifics of the computational resources available to you is important. Knowing the specifics of the computaional resources available to you is imortant because they dictate the limitations of your specific device with respect to the amount of data you can process and the speed with which you can process them. Since the ability to process different quantities and types of data is tied to the specs of the machines they are processed on, it is also important to accurately report this information in research reports. This information gives the computational scientist knowledge about how readily reproducible your work may be.

**Therefore, I would like you to document the specs of your own computer. Specifically, I would like you to report the model, processor, memory, and operating system.** 

The operating system, regardless of MacOS, PC, or linux should have a specific version. This should be written in the form of a markdown file in the "Week_1" directory. This directory. If you have any questions about how to find this information, don't be afraid to email me (Theron Palmer).

## Creating a github account

Github is a means of version-controlling computional projects collaboratively. Version control is necessary for proper management of computational projects and software development, as keeping track of all aspects of software can be difficult and mistakes can be made. Through version-controlled development, mistakes are not necessarily catastrophic since all documented versions of your code are retained. Collaboration is generally a necessity in research, and computational research, along with much of the software development it requires, is no different.
